**This is multivariate time series classification task**


<h3><i> About the project:  </i></h3>


Sleep disorders can be the consequence of many factors. For example, Sleep apnea is of the most serious sleep disorders. It can cause
heart attack and depression, hypotension, diminished immune function ..etc.


In PhysioNet challenge of 2018, we have more than 13 signals records of +1900 subjects ( 994 subjects for Training (+ 100 GB) and
 998 subjects for Testing)

**The **objective** is** to automatically detect arousal regions in the signals. Traditionally, this task required visual inspection by scientists and doctors which can be a
time-consuming task.

The detection automation of sleep arousals regions will allow faster evaluation of sleep disorder for each subject.
