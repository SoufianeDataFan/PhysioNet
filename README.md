**Automatic signal inspection to detect sleep apnea**

<h3><i> About the project:  </i></h3>

Well, if you don't know what is Sleep Apnea, I wish you'll never have it because it's really bad. 
People with sleep apnea can't sleep at night because their breathing stops repeatedly and starts again. Lack of sleep at night will cause daytime sleepness. As a result, the person can't sleep enough and can't stay awake either. 

When this situation lasts for weeks or months, you can imagine how painful this can be. In fact, sleep apnea can reportedly cause depression, heart problem, High blood pressure ..etc. [learn more](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/sleep-apnea/sleep-apnea)

>Furthermore, While apneas are arguably the best understood of sleep disturbances, they are not the only cause of disturbance. Sleep arousals can also be spontaneous, result from teeth grinding, partial airway obstructions, or even snoring. In this year's PhysioNet Challenge we will use a variety of physiological signals, collected during polysomnographic sleep studies, to detect these other sources of arousal (non-apnea) during sleep.
In PhysioNet challenge of 2018, we have more than 13 signals records of +1900 subjects ( 994 subjects for Training (+ 100 GB) and
 998 subjects for Testing)

**The **objective** is** to automatically detect arousal regions in the signals. Traditionally, this task required visual inspection by scientists and doctors which can be a
time-consuming task.

The detection automation of sleep arousals regions will allow faster evaluation of sleep disorder for each subject.
